# Superpixel-Generator-using-SLIC

This code has many components, starting from clustering on RGB space, RGBXY space and finally Superpixel generator using SLIC algorithm. In the end, there is also an implementation of optimized SLIC algoritm for better superpixel generation. Please refer the Superpixels.ipynb file for code, results and images.
